Bowling Challenge
=================

- A game consists of 10 frames
- The player can knock up to 10 pins
- In every frame a player can roll one or two times (depeding on strikes & spares)
- The score of a frame depends on the players knocked down pins & their bonuses for spares and strikes
- After every frame the 10 pins are reset
- The player has a stike if he knocks down all 10 pins with the first roll in a frame
- The bonus for that fram is the number of pins knocked down by the next two rolls
- The bonus would be the total of the two rolls after the strike
- Unless the player has a strike
- The player has a spare if the player knocks down all 10 pins in a frame
- The bonus for that spare would be the number of pins knocked down in the next roll
- If the player rolls a strike or spare in the 10th frame they can roll the additional balls for the bonus
- They can never roll more than 3 balls in the 10th frame
- If the player never hits a pin they have a gutter game
- If the player rolls 12 strikes, they have a perfect game
